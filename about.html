                        <p>Every day, many people head home, hoping for a safe journey after a long day. However, we have all heard of unfortunate incidents and accidents on the way home. It's a problem we've had to face, and we felt the need to do something about it.
						</p>
						<p>That's why we created our website. We realised how unsafe it is to travel to and from work and parties, and we decided to come up with a solution. Our aim is to make journeys safer and more reliable for everyone. By collaborating with others, sharing journeys and offering safer options, we believe we can make a difference.</p>
                      <p>We are driven by the belief that no one should have to fear for their safety on the way home. With your support and commitment, we work every day to make this vision a reality. Join us in our quest to make every journey home as safe as possible.</p>

                        <p>Our site was created to meet a fundamental need: to offer everyone the chance to get home safely, while enjoying the benefits of sharing a journey with others. Here's how our platform works:</p>
                      <p><b>Create an account:</b> The first step is to create a personal account. You can do this in just a few minutes by providing some basic information, such as your name, e-mail address and a password.</p>
						<p><b>Propose a group journey:</b> Once you have registered, you can propose a group journey. You specify the departure time, the meeting point and the final destination. You can also indicate how many passengers you are prepared to take with you. This feature allows you to share the cost of the journey, making it more economical for everyone.</p>	
						<p><b>Search for Passengers:</b> On the other hand, users looking for a journey can browse the journey offers available on our platform. They can filter journeys by location, departure time and destination. As soon as they find a journey that matches their needs, they can book their place.</p>	
						<p><b>Meeting at the Rendezvous Point :</b> On the day of the journey, the driver and passengers meet at a pre-arranged meeting point. This meeting is an opportunity to get to know each other, discuss the details of the journey, and make sure everyone is comfortable with the situation. Once everyone is on board, the journey can begin.</p>	
						<p><b>Group travel:</b> There are many advantages to travelling in a group. It increases safety, reduces journey costs and creates a friendly atmosphere. Passengers and driver share the experience of the journey, which can make it more enjoyable.</p>
						<p><b>Providing Contact Information:</b> For safety reasons, our platform encourages users to share contact information before the journey. This allows all participants to stay in touch and coordinate the journey more easily, should the need arise.</p>
						<p><b>Reviews and ratings:</b> After the journey, users have the opportunity to leave reviews and ratings for the driver and passengers. This feature helps to maintain a respectful and reliable travel environment.
						</p>
						<p>In short, our site aims to make the journey home safer, more affordable and more enjoyable for everyone. Whether you're looking for a ride or would like to offer a group ride, our platform is here to make it easier for you to travel with confidence. Join our community and find out how we can improve your commuting experience.</p>
